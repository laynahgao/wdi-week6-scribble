The `.` creates a new Django app inside the *CURRENT* folder. Otherwise, it creates a new folder. 

<!-- For instance, if you did `rails new scribble` it would create a `scribble` folder and put the Rails app inside there. -->

> This is how a lot of people end up with a `scribble` folder inside another `scribble` folder.
